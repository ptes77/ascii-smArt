Intelligent ascii art v0.1

**ONLY ACCEPTS PNG IMAGES**

There's still a lot that can be done to this small project.
 - Accept formats other than only png
 - User inputs (file directory, pixel filter size)
 - The "intelligent" part of the program, which determines borders in the image
 - Convert to png/jpg
 - Accepts videos and generate gifs with desired fps
 - Medium post about the process (hehe)
